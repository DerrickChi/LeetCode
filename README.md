Pure C solution for LeetCode
============================

This project aims at solving [LeetCode algorithm problems] with pure C Language 
using as less library functions as I can, which means except memory management
functions and few string functions I will implement everything I need such
as tree, stack and hash table.

Parts of the problems don't provide C interface for solution, so I accomplished
them with C++ Language.
